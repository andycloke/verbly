## Verbly

[Live Version](http://verbly.io).

An app for practising Spanish Verb Conjugations. A re-write of the original Verb Master that I wrote in 2017.

New to this Version:

* Much smaller bundle (down from ~17MB to 0.5MB), due to fetching conjugations data separately to the app.
* Mobile performance issues fixed.
* Saving user stats to local storage between sessions and using them to decide what verb-tense combinations to show.
* Different URLs for menu / game.

Libraries/ languages used:

* React
* Redux
* TypeScript
* React Router
* SCSS (SASS) for styles
* CSS Grid
* [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for tests
